## 2024-05-23 - Playback Control and Clip Library UX Improvements
**Learning:** Users heavily rely on keyboard shortcuts for playback (Space) but often don't know they exist or if they are active. Explicitly mentioning shortcuts in tooltips significantly improves discoverability.
**Action:** Always add tooltips to primary control buttons (Play, Stop, etc.) that include the keyboard shortcut, even if it seems "standard".

**Learning:** "Import" buttons without tooltips are ambiguous. Does it import files? Folders? From where?
**Action:** Add descriptive tooltips to action buttons like "Import Clips" to clarify the source and expected behavior.
